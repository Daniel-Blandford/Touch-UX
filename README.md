# Touch-UX
Providing adjustments to Gnome-Desktop to help improve the experience on touch screen devices such as tablets, phones and PDA's running Gnome such as the PinePhone. This is in early development with more features expected later.

# Project Goals
* Touch-UX was developed as an initial starting point for touch screen device optimisations for Gnome-Desktop to make Gnome more practical on devices such as Linux smartphones, PDA's, Tablets and more.
* The idea behind Touch-UX is to provide a single extension that enables most of the core essentials required to provide a usable touch screen device user experience without spending too much time configuring the device.
* As I am new to Linux development, obviously it would likely take me quite some time to acheive the goals of this project on my own and so I thought to publish an early version and make it open for anybody to submit changes in the hope that we can push the project forward much more rapidly.

# Features
* Gesture bar - Swipe up to display Gnome overview.
* Force display on screen keyboard - If the keyboard doesn't display when expected, you can request it to show manually (click status bar icon - if enabled - and select 'Show keyboard' in menu).

# Planned Features
* Notification center - As the goal is to provide a fully usable touch screen experience on devices such as smartphones and PDA's, a more touch friendly notification/quick settings panel would be a logical step in the right direction.
* Edge swipe gestures - Swipe horizontally to switch apps/workspaces by default. This has not yet been implemented as I'd like to further improve on the implementation of the swipe gesture system for the gesture bar before implementing advanced edge swipe gestures elsewhere. As the project progresses I would like to make the edge gestures configurable to perform custom actions to suit the individual users needs.

# Personal Note
Please bare in mind that I'm new to Linux/Gnome development and I also have a daily job to attend to and so my time may be somewhat limited to evenings and weekends at best, which is one of the reasons that I thought it would be best to look to collaborate with other Gnome Extension developers to progress this project and help to push forward the Linux phone experience with Gnome as the DE and also enabling convergence mode to be more practical as it would be able to scale up to work exactly the same as Gnome on a desktop workstation.
